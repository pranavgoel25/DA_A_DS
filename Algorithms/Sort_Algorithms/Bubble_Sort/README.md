#Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm.This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements
is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

##Algorithm

We compare each pair of adjacent items and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

##Complexity

Bubble Sort taken O(N*N) time to run.
